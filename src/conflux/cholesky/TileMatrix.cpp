/**
 * @brief constructor of a tile matrix
 * 
 * constructs a new tile matrix, which is either a tile-column vector in 1
 * dimension or a tile matrix in 2 dimensions. The tiles will be stored 
 * contiguously in memory, which makes it useful to perform larger GEMM 
 * operations with LAPACK, which should lead to performance increases.
 * 
 * @param type the type of the tile matrix, either VECTOR or MATRIX
 * @param rowsPerTile the number of rows per tile
 * @param colsPerTile the number of cols per tile
 * @param tileRows the number of tile rows in this matrix
 * @param tileCols the number of tile cols in this matrix, defaults to 1
